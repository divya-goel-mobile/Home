        Prudential plc provides life and health insurance and asset management,
        with a focus on Asia and Africa. We help people get the most out of
        life, by making healthcare affordable and accessible and by promoting
        financial inclusion. We protect people’s wealth, help them grow their
        assets, and empower them to save for their goals. The business has more
        than 18 million customers in Asia and Africa. We are no longer
